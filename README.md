# nuMAJE
Repository for the refactoring of old MAJEstic features/commands and readapting them to nuMAJE.
Each command is contained in its own directory.

Disclaimer: This code is old, very old. The original MAJE project was my very first Python project, and the nuMAJE project is a thing because I wanted to fix it.
